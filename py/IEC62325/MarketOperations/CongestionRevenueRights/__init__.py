Congestion rent is a major, highly volatile charge currently faced by many
participants in the LMP-based electrical energy markets. For this reason,
the ISOs offer congestion revenue rights (CRR), also known as financial transmission
rights or transmission congestion contracts. These are financial instruments that allow
market participants to hedge against congestion
charges when they schedule their generation, load and bilateral energy transactions.
