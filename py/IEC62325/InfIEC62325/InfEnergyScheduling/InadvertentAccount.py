    An account for tracking inadvertent interchange versus time for each control area. 
    A control area may have more than one inadvertent account in order to 
    track inadvertent over one or more specific tie points in addition to the usual 
    overall net inadvertent. Separate accounts would also be used to track 
    designated time periods, such as on-peak and off-peak.
