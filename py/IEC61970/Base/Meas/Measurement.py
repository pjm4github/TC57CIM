class Measurement(IdentifiedObject):
    """A Measurement represents any measured, calculated or non-measured non-
    calculated quantity. Any piece of equipment may contain Measurements, e.g. a
    substation may have temperature measurements and door open indications, a
    transformer may have oil temperature and tank pressure measurements, a bay may
    contain a number of power flow measurements and a Breaker may contain a switch
    status measurement.
      The PSR - Measurement association is intended to capture this use of
    Measurement and is included in the naming hierarchy based on EquipmentContainer.
    The naming hierarchy typically has Measurements as leafs, e.g. Substation-
    VoltageLevel-Bay-Switch-Measurement.
      Some Measurements represent quantities related to a particular sensor
    location in the network, e.g. a voltage transformer (PT) at a busbar or a
    current transformer (CT) at the bar between a breaker and an isolator. The
    sensing position is not captured in the PSR - Measurement association. Instead
    it is captured by the Measurement - Terminal association that is used to define
    the sensing location in the network topology. The location is defined by the
    connection of the Terminal to ConductingEquipment.
      If both a Terminal and PSR are associated, and the PSR is of type
    ConductingEquipment, the associated Terminal should belong to that
    ConductingEquipment instance.
      When the sensor location is needed both Measurement-PSR and Measurement-
    Terminal are used. The Measurement-Terminal association is never used alone.
