class EarthFaultCompensator:
    """
    A conducting equipment used to represent a connection to ground which is typically used to compensate earth faults. An earth fault compensator device modeled with a single terminal implies a second terminal solidly connected to ground. If two terminals are modeled, the ground is not assumed and normal connection rules apply.
