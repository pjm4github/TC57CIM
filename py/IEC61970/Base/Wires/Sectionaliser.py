class Sectionaliser(Switch):
    # Automatic switch that will lock open to isolate a faulted section. It may, or
    # may not, have load breaking capability. Its primary purpose is to provide fault
    # sectionalising at locations where the fault current is either too high, or too
    # low, for proper coordination of fuses.
