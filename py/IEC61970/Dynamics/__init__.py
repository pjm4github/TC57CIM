"""
The CIM dynamic model definitions reflect the most common IEEE or, in the case of wind models, IEC,
representations of models as well as models included in some of the transient stability software widely
used by utilities.

These dynamic models are intended to ensure interoperability between different vendors’ software products currently
in use by electric utility energy companies, utilities, TSOs and RTO/ISOs.  It is important to note that each vendor
is free to select its own internal implementation of these models.  Differences in vendor results, as long as they
are within accepted engineering practice, caused by different internal representations, are acceptable.

Notes:
1. Wind models package is defined in accordance with IEC 61400-27-1.
