__description__ = """
This section describes the standard interconnections for various types of equipment. These interconnections are 
understood by the application programs and can be identified based on the presence of one of the key classes with a 
relationship to the static power flow model: SynchronousMachineDynamics, AsynchronousMachineDynamics, 
EnergyConsumerDynamics or WindTurbineType3or4Dynamics. 
The relationships between classes expressed in the interconnection diagrams are intended to support dynamic behaviour 
described by either standard models or user-defined models.
In the interconnection diagrams, boxes which are black in colour represent function blocks whose functionality can be 
provided by one of many standard models or by a used-defined model. Blue boxes represent specific standard models.  
A dashed box means that the function block or specific standard model is optional.
