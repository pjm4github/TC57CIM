__description__ = """
In some particular system configurations, continuous excitation control with terminal voltage and power system 
stabilizing regulator input signals does not ensure that the potential of the excitation system for improving system 
stability is fully exploited. For these situations, discontinuous excitation control signals may be employed to 
enhance stability following large transient disturbances.

For additional information please refer to IEEE Standard 421.5-2005, Section 12.
