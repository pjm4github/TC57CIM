__description__ = """
For conventional power generating units (e.g., thermal, hydro, combustion turbine), a synchronous machine model represents the electrical characteristics of the generator and the mechanical characteristics of the turbine-generator rotational inertia.  Large industrial motors or groups of similar motors may be represented by individual motor models which are represented as generators with negative active power in the static (power flow) data.  

The interconnection with the electrical network equations may differ among simulation tools.  The tool only needs to know the synchronous machine to establish the correct interconnection.  The interconnection with motorâ€™s equipment could also differ due to input and output signals required by standard models.
