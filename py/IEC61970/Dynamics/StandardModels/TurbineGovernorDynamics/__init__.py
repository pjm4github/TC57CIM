__description__ = """
The turbine-governor model is linked to one or two synchronous generators and determines the shaft mechanical power 
(Pm) or torque (Tm) for the generator model.  
Unlike IEEE standard models for other function blocks, the three IEEE turbine-governor standard models 
(GovHydroIEEE0, GovHydroIEEE2, GovSteamIEEE1) are documented in IEEE Transactions not in IEEE standards. For that 
reason, diagrams are supplied for those models.
A 2012 IEEE report, Dynamic Models for Turbine-Governors in Power System Studies, provides updated information on 
a variety of models including IEEE, vendor and reliability authority models.  Fully incorporating the results of 
that report into the CIM Dynamics model is a future effort.
