__description__ = """
Overexcitation limiters (OELs) are also referred to as maximum excitation limiters and field current limiters. The possibility of voltage collapse in stressed power systems increases the importance of modelling these limiters in studies of system conditions that cause machines to operate at high levels of excitation for a sustained period, such as voltage collapse or system-islanding. Such events typically occur over a long time frame compared with transient or small-signal stability simulations.
