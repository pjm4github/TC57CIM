__description__ = """
Excitation systems for synchronous machines are sometimes supplied with an optional means of automatically adjusting generator output reactive power (VAr) or power factor (PF) to a user-specified value This can be accomplished with either a reactive power or power factor controller or regulator.  A reactive power or power factor controller is defined as a PF/VAr controller in IEEE Std 421.1 as “A control function that acts through the reference adjuster to modify the voltage regulator set point to maintain the synchronous machine steady-state power factor or reactive power at a predetermined value.” 

For additional information please refer to IEEE Standard 421.5-2005, Section 11.
