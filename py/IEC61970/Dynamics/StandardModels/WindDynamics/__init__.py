__description__ = """
Wind turbines are generally divided into 4 types, which are currently significant in power systems. The 4 types have 
the following characteristics:
Type 1: Wind turbine with directly grid connected asynchronous generator with fixed rotor resistance (typically 
squirrel cage)
Type 2: Wind turbine with directly grid connected asynchronous generator with variable rotor resistance
Type 3: Wind turbines with doubly-fed asynchronous generators (directly connected stator and rotor connected 
through power converter)
Type 4: Wind turbines connected fully through a power converter.

Models included in this package are according to IEC 61400-27-1.

Note: Each attribute is categorized as type, project, or case parameter. The definitions related to this 
categorization are specified by IEC 61400-27-1, section 6.4.2.
