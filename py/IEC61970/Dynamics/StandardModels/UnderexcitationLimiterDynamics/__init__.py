Underexcitation limiters (UELs) act to boost excitation. The UEL typically senses either a combination of voltage and 
current of the synchronous machine or a combination of real and reactive power. Some UELs utilize a temperature or 
pressure recalibration feature, in which the UEL characteristic is shifted depending upon the generator cooling gas 
temperature or pressure.
