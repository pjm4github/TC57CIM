    Asset container that performs one or more end device functions. One type of end
    device is a meter which can perform metering, load management,
    connect/disconnect, accounting functions, etc. Some end devices, such as ones
    monitoring and controlling air conditioners, refrigerators, pool pumps may be
    connected to a meter. All end devices may have communication capability defined
    by the associated communication function(s). An end device may be owned by a
    consumer, a service provider, utility or otherwise.
    There may be a related end device function that identifies a sensor or control
    point within a metering application or communications systems (e.g., water, gas,
    electricity).
    Some devices may use an optical port that conforms to the ANSI C12.18 standard
    for communications.
