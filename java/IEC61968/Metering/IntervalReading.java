 * Data captured at regular intervals of time. Interval data could be captured as

 * usually a tariff quantity or an engineering quantity. Data is typically
 * captured in time-tagged, uniform, fixed-length intervals of 5 min, 10 min, 15
 * min, 30 min, or 60 min.
 * Note: Interval Data is sometimes also called "Interval Data Readings" (IDR).
