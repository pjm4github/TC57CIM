    # Note 1: When used to describe VA, "lagging" describes a form of measurement
    # where reactive power is considered in all four quadrants, but real power is
    # considered only in quadrants I and IV.
    # Note 2: When used to describe power factor, the term "Lagging" implies that the
    # PF is negative. The term "lagging" in this case takes the place of the negative
    # sign. If a signed PF value is to be passed by the data producer, then the
    # direction of flow enumeration zero (none) should be used in order to avoid the
    # possibility of creating an expression that employs a double negative. The data
    # consumer should be able to tell from the sign of the data if the PF is leading
    # or lagging. This principle is analogous to the concept that "Reverse" energy is
    # an implied negative value, and to publish a negative reverse value would be
    # ambiguous.
