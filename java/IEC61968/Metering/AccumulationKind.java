	 * roll-under behavior so that the value presented is always a positive value (e.g.

	 * consumption over a specific period of time.

	 * Note: A 'latchingQuantity' may also occur in the downward direction - upon
	 * reaching a minimum value. The terms 'maximum' or 'minimum' (for 'aggregate')
	 * will usually be included when this type of accumulation behaviour is present.
	 * When this description is applied to an encoded value (UOM= 'Code'), it implies
	 * that the value has one or more bits which are latching. The condition that
	 * caused the bit to be set may have long since evaporated.
	 * In either case, the timestamp that accompanies the value may not coincide with
	 * the moment the value was initially set.
