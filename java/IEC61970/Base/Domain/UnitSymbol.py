class UnitSymbol:
    """The derived units defined for usage in the CIM. In some cases, the derived unit
    is equal to an SI unit. Whenever possible, the standard derived symbol is used
    instead of the formula for the derived unit. For example, the unit symbol Farad
    is defined as "F" instead of "CPerV". In cases where a standard symbol does not
    exist for a derived unit, the formula for the unit is used as the unit symbol.
    For example, density does not have a standard symbol and so it is represented
    as "kgPerm3". With the exception of the "kg", which is an SI unit, the unit
    symbols do not contain multipliers and therefore represent the base derived
    unit to which a multiplier can be applied as a whole.
    
      Every unit symbol is treated as an unparseable text as if it were a single-
    letter symbol. The meaning of each unit symbol is defined by the accompanying
    descriptive text and not by the text contents of the unit symbol.
    
      To allow the widest possible range of serializations without requiring
    special character handling, several substitutions are made which deviate from
    the format described in IEC 80000-1. The division symbol "/" is replaced by the
    letters"Per". Exponents are written in plain text after the unit as "m3"
    instead of being formatted as in "m<sup>3</sup>" or introducing a symbol as in
    "m^3". The degree symbol "ø" is replaced with the letters "deg". Any
    clarification of the meaning for a substitution is included in the description
    for the unit symbol.
    
      Non-SI units are included in list of unit symbols to allow sources of data to
    be correctly labeled with their non-SI units (for example, a GPS sensor that is
    reporting numbers that represent feet instead of meters). This allows software
    to use the unit symbol information correctly convert and scale the raw data of
    those sources into SI-based units.
