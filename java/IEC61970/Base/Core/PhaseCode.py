class PhaseCode:
    """An unordered enumeration of phase identifiers.  Allows designation of phases
    for both transmission and distribution equipment, circuits and loads.   The
    enumeration, by itself, does not describe how the phases are connected together
    or connected to ground.  Ground is not explicitly denoted as a phase.
      Residential and small commercial loads are often served from single-phase, or
    split-phase, secondary circuits. For example of s12N, phases 1 and 2 refer to
    hot wires that are 180 degrees out of phase, while N refers to the neutral wire.
    Through single-phase transformer connections, these secondary circuits may be
    served from one or two of the primary phases A, B, and C. For three-phase loads,
    use the A, B, C phase codes instead of s12N.
