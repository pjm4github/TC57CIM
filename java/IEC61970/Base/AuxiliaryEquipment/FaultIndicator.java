 * A FaultIndicator is typically only an indicator (which may or may not be
 * remotely monitored), and not a piece of equipment that actually initiates a
 * protection event. It is used for FLISR (Fault Location, Isolation and
 * Restoration) purposes, assisting with the dispatch of crews to "most likely"
 * part of the network (i.e. assists with determining circuit section where the
 * fault most likely happened).
